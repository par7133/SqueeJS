# SqueeJS
Hello and welcome to SqueeJS!  
  
SqueeJS is one more Javascript framework pointing to squeeze the javascript code required by your web pages. Its main focus in the GUI, as other coding subjects like client translation and geolocalization.. of the interface.<br>
As SqueeJS has both client side code (code and doc, MIT) and server-side code (geolocalization, BSD-3) so that SqueeJS.com can't run on GitHub.. the development of SqueeJS doesn't happen seemlessly with its GitHub repository life cycle. However our hope is to involve the developer community in suggesting features, bug fixes and so forth that will be imported asap.

APPRECIATED: if you want to pass some funny moments you can check my bolognese translation of "user_translation.html". Further more you are welcome to translate it to your local dialect, just remember to send me a copy of it so that we can publish it in favor of everyone's laugh. LOL!
