# SqueeJS
Hello and welcome to SqueeJS!  
  
SqueeJS is one more Javascript framework pointing to squeeze the javascript code required by your web pages. Its main focus in the GUI, as other coding subjects like client translation (please check my bolognese translation to have fun!) and geolocalization.. of the interface.<br>
As SqueeJS has both client side code (code and doc, MIT) and server-side code (geolocalization, BSD-3) so that SqueeJS.com can't run on GitHub.. the development of SqueeJS doesn't happen seemlessly with its GitHub repository life cycle. However our hope is to involve the developer community in suggesting features, bug fixes and so forth that will be imported asap.
